# 5G_NR_Simulation
This project simulates the 5G MAC layer in MATLAB. It shows how multiple devices (UEs) send data to a base station (gNB). It handles traffic, manages buffers, retries failed transmissions, schedules users fairly, picks the best data rates, assigns resources, and sends feedback like ACKs and NACKs.
